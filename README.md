# HoyoMap!

My attempt at a 3D reconstruction of Teyvat, directly sourced from the game files. I extracted the gamefiles from my Android data and unpacked them with [Escartem's wonderful tool](https://github.com/Escartem/AnimeStudio). I had to do a lot of filling in the blanks for the Ocean data (Genshin's water meshes are all OVER the place) and I ultimately couldn't find the texture maps for any of the data other than Mondstadt and the ground planes. However, the city meshes are in surprising detail! I'm hoping that someone smarter than me can come along and find the mappings for the rest of the mesh data + textures for them, at which point we can properly build a full recreation of Teyvat in all it's beautiful glory.
